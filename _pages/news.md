### New Paper Alert

<em>October 2024</em> <br>

As populations recover from decline, how do we know which management efforts are still needed?
Check out our new paper in <em>Ecosphere</em>, where my co-authors Tuk Jacobson,
Jamey Driscoll, Kyle McCarty, Javan Bauder, and I developed an integrated 
population model (IPM) and conducted a population viability analysis (PVA)
to examine how nest-level management actions affect reproductive success and 
projected population growth in Arizona's bald eagles.
The paper is open access and available from
[Ecosphere](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.4943). 
The code and data are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11051071).

### In the Field

<em>July 2024</em> <br>

This July, I traveled to the Galápagos, Ecuador with Dee Boersma to continue our
[Galápagos penguin project](https://ecosystemsentinels.org/galapagos-penguin-project/).
It was a bittersweet couple of weeks, as it was our first research trip
since the passing of our friend and collaborator Godfrey Merlen in 2023.
The trip also marked the start of an exciting new chapter in our penguin
research, with the addition of fantastic new collaborators. 
You can read more about our trip in the 
[Fall 2024 newsletter](https://ecosystemsentinels.org/field-updates-galapagos-islands-summer-2024/)
from the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels.

### Webinar: Planning for Accessibility in Web-based Meetings

<em>June 2024</em> <br>

I recently co-organized a webinar on videoconferencing accessibility with The 
Wildlife Society's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Awareness (IDEA) and 
Disability, Neurodivergence, and Allyship (DNA) Working Groups. The speaker, 
Mark Boyden, gave and excellent presentation and I learned a lot! Check out the 
recording here: [https://wildlife.org/events/event/in-planning-video-conferences-are-you-including-people-with-disabilities/](https://wildlife.org/events/event/in-planning-video-conferences-are-you-including-people-with-disabilities/)
