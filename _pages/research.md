My research interests are in wildlife ecology, conservation biology, and natural 
history. I use a combination of field studies, remote sensing, and quantitative tools to 
understand how global change and human activities affect the performance, ecological 
interactions, and dynamics of wildlife populations. My research as a PhD Candidate 
in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington focuses on the ecology 
and conservation of two South American penguin species. My overarching goal is to
conduct research that guides the conservation of threatened species, 
the mitigation of human-wildlife conflict, and that furthers understanding of the
foundations of wildlife ecology and behavior. 


#### Drivers of phenology and consequences of phenological shifts:

Shifts in phenology (i.e. the timing of important life events such as growth, 
migration, or reproduction) are among the best documented organismal responses 
to global change, but it is often difficult to predict how these shifts in timing
impact individual performance or population dynamics. Arrival and egg laying dates 
have shifted later in the once-largest colony of Magellanic penguins at Punta Tombo,
Argentina. As  part of my PhD dissertation, I examined the consequences of this 
shift by 1) exploring  the interaction between the timing of egg laying and of 
subsequent breeding-season events like fledging ([Cappello & Boersma 2021 Ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3443)), 
and 2) by investigating the potential for increasing mismatch between penguin 
breeding and the window of  optimal oceanographic conditions and food availability. 
These studies leveraged large and long-term datasets from field studies and remote 
sensing to better understand how species will perform under changing environmental 
conditions.

#### Conservation of rare and endangered species:

Populations of rare and endangered species have urgent conservation needs yet are often among the most difficult to study. The Galapagos penguin is Endangered
on the IUCN Red List, and its population is small and remote. My work with this species
aims to reveal components of its natural history, behavior, and demography that 
will aid in developing effective conservation strategies. For example, I tested 
the accuracy of less invasive methods (e.g. morphometric measurements, subtle
markings on otherwise monomorphic plumage) for determining the sex of individual
penguins ([Cappello & Boersma 2018 Endangered Species Research](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v35/p169-173/)). I am currently 
working on analyses to determine the thermal and physical properties 
of Galapagos penguin nests that best predict if a penguin will occupy the nest. 
This information will be useful for designing artificial nests to increase breeding 
opportunities for this small and endangered population.

_Integrated population modeling:_ Management and funding allocation decisions frequently 
rely on population trajectory estimates, but uncertainty in trends can be high when
data are sparse. As part of a collaborative effort, I am currently working on a 
simulation analysis that evaluates the performance of integrated population models 
(IPMs), which may help overcome data limitations, but their accuracy remains 
underexplored. This work aims to help researchers evaluate the pros and cons of 
using the IPM framework, particularly when studying rare or difficult-to-study populations.
