I am a PhD Candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [Biology Department](https://www.biology.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, studying seabird ecology and conservation with the [Center for Ecosystem Sentinels](https://ecosystemsentinels.org/). I graduated from Brandeis University with bachelorâ€™s degrees in environmental studies and theater arts. My focus on wildlife ecology and conservation as an undergraduate provided the opportunity to study large mammal ecology in Tanzania and Kenya. After graduating and before landing at the University of Washington, I wandered the country as a seasonal field ecologist, working primarily with birds and mammals. Some highlights from those nomadic years include calibrating activity sensors for elk in Oregon, mist-netting yellow-billed cuckoos in the Sonoran Desert, skiing after American martens and other mesocarnivores in snowy Wisconsin forests, and managing piping plover and least tern populations along the coast of Maine. When not chasing after wildlife, I can be found hiking, backpacking, running, birding, braising all manner of vegetables, drinking mediocre coffee, or reading a good book. I use she/her pronouns.
