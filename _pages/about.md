I am a PhD Candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Biology Department at the University of Washington, studying seabird ecology and conservation with the [Center for Ecosystem Sentinels](https://ecosystemsentinels.org/). I graduated from Brandeis University with bachelorâ€™s degrees in environmental studies and theater arts (yep, theater arts!). My focus on wildlife ecology and conservation as an undergraduate provided the opportunity to study large mammal ecology in Tanzania and Kenya. After graduating and before landing at the University of Washington, I wandered the country as a seasonal field ecologist, working primarily with birds and mammals. Some highlights from those nomadic years include calibrating activity sensors for elk in Oregon, mist-netting yellow-billed cuckoos in the Sonoran Desert, skiing after American martens in snowy Wisconsin forests, and managing breeding piping plover and least tern populations along the coast of southern Maine. When not chasing after wildlife, I can be found birding, running, hiking, backpacking, braising all manner of vegetables, drinking mediocre coffee, or reading a good book.
