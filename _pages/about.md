I am a wildlife ecologist working as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the [Center for Avian Population Studies](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/center-for-avian-population-studies/) at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology
and collaborating with the [Applied Quantitative Ecology Lab](https://gavinmjones.com/) at the University of New Mexico.
I recently completed a Postdoctoral Researcher position with the [Arizona Cooperative Research Unit](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Arizona) and 
received my PhD in 2022 from the Biology Department at the University of Washington, where I continue to collaborate with the [Center for Ecosystem Sentinels](https://ecosystemsentinels.org/) on studies of seabird ecology and conservation.

I received my undergraduate degree from Brandeis University, where my focus on environmental studies
provided the opportunity to study large mammal ecology in Tanzania and Kenya. 
After undergrad and before pursuing a graduate degree, I wandered the country as a seasonal field ecologist, 
working primarily with birds and mammals. Some highlights from those nomadic years include calibrating
activity sensors for elk in Oregon, mist-netting yellow-billed cuckoos in the Sonoran Desert, skiing
after American martens and other mesocarnivores in snowy Wisconsin forests, and managing piping plover
and least tern populations along the coast of Maine.

When not chasing after wildlife, I can be found hiking, backpacking, running, braising all manner of vegetables, drinking mediocre coffee, or reading a good book. I use she/her pronouns.
