I am a wildlife ecologist working as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the [Arizona Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Arizona) at the University of Arizona. I received my PhD in 2022 from the [Biology Department](https://www.biology.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, where I continue to collaborate with the [Center for Ecosystem Sentinels](https://ecosystemsentinels.org/) on studies of seabird ecology and conservation.

I received my undergraduate degree from Brandeis University, where my focus on environmental studies provided the opportunity to study large mammal ecology in Tanzania and Kenya. After undergrad and before pursuing a graduate degree, I wandered the country as a seasonal field ecologist, working primarily with birds and mammals. Some highlights from those nomadic years include calibrating activity sensors for elk in Oregon, mist-netting yellow-billed cuckoos in the Sonoran Desert, skiing after American martens and other mesocarnivores in snowy Wisconsin forests, and managing piping plover and least tern populations along the coast of Maine.

When not chasing after wildlife, I can be found hiking, backpacking, running, birding, braising all manner of vegetables, drinking mediocre coffee, or reading a good book. I use she/her pronouns.
